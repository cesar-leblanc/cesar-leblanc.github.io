<p>All the talks I've participated in (whether they were big international conferences, medium continental meetings, or small national seminars) were held in Europe and relatively close to my lab because, for obvious ecological reasons, I do not wish to travel by plane. Every event where I was invited or accepted and that was not reachable by trains or buses, no matter how prestigious, was either declined or attended remotely.</p>
