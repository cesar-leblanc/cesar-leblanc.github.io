<p>Whether it was during big international conferences, medium continental meetings, or small national seminars, I was lucky to be able to present my work in a lot of different places. However, all the talks I've participated in were held in Europe and (relatively) close to my laboratory because, for obvious ecological reasons, I do not wish to travel by plane. Every event where I was invited or accepted and that was not reachable by trains or buses, no matter how prestigious, was either declined or attended remotely (e.g., I did not attend <strong>CLEF 2023</strong>, <strong>NeurIPS 2024</strong>, or <strong>CVPR 2025</strong>, despite the fact that I had papers accepted there and that they are among the primary conferences of high impact in my field of research, because they were held respectively in <em>Thessaloniki</em>, <em>Vancouver</em>, and <em>Nashville</em>).</p>
