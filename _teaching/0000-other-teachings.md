In addition to the main teachings, I also had the opportunity to teach a lot of students with different backgrounds.  
Here is a list of some of my experiences:
- intensive preparatory courses to train students for enrolment in one of the *grandes écoles* (e.g., *École Polytechnique* and *École Normale Supérieure*)
- accompagnying students with difficult backgrounds and/or disabilities and preventing them from dropping out of the educational system (volunteer work)
- helping *collège* and *lycée* students with homeworks and revisions so they keep up with their classes and obtain their diplomas (i.e., *brevet* and *baccalauréat*)
- replacing my colleagues and/or supervisors when they are not available to teach their own university classes (e.g., *Object-oriented programming*)
- participating in an association at my graduate school of engineering to help students struggling with certain courses (in particular in mathematics and physics)
